                            <p>My name is Carter Bunn and I am majoring in Computer Science. Some hobbies I have are hunting, lifting, and playing pickleball. 
                                Over the summer I did those hobbies while working for an energy management company 
                                and going on vacation to Door County, WI. After I graduate I hope to work for a company 
                                with close ties to agriculture as of right now I am thinking I would like to be a software developer. 
                                I choose agriculture because I am from a rural part of Wisconsin and there is lots of technology coming out in the agriculture sector 
                                even though to some it seems to them that farming hasn't changed at all.</p>
