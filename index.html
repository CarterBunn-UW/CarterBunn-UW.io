                                <p>This fall I tried out and made the UW Madison Club Pickleball team. This was very difficult as there were over 
                                    100 men who tried out for 12 spots on the team. It has been really fun and the team has had a good amount of 
                                    success as we sent one team to Texas for DUPPR Collegiate Nationals this past fall.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>In a new class this fall called English 100 we had to write an essay that was a letter to writing. 
                                    It was kind of tough to fill two pages with content but was a pretty easy essay other than that. 
                                    In the essay I talk about how I wish I could go back to the dayâ€™s when I liked to write but now I 
                                    just try to get it done quickly. I look forward to what we learn and write about 
                                    the rest of the semester as our next essay is about a place that is special to us.</p>
